        <h3>How We Met</h3>
        <p>
            Emily and Andrew met on the dating app "Hinge". After sending ~5 messages Andrew said that he knew enough
            and was ready to meet Emily in person. They met for their first date at SunKing Brewery in Carmel on
            February 16, 2019. They went on date number two the following Tuesday, going to dinner at La Margarita and
            going duckpin bowling in Fountain Square. Emily was finally convinced that more dates should happen after
            car singing and dancing to Luke Bryan's "Shake it for me" and Miley Cyrus's far better, "Party in the USA".
            On April 3, Andrew told Emily she was his girlfriend and she agreed. <br> <br>
            Andrew picked up Emily and her mom at the airport after a trip to Ireland, and after dropping
            Coleen off at home, Emily and Andrew picked up dinner at the Chic-fil-a. Midway through the meal,
            with a waffle fry in her mouth, Andrew told Emily that he loved her. She responded with "I know".
            The next night, Emily tried to be as smooth as Andrew while we were at dinner at Loco in Fountain Square,
            hoping to reciprocate her feelings, while Andrew had a chip in his mouth. However she chickened out because
            we were sitting too close to another table. We went back to Andrew's house and watched Bird Box, and after
            the
            movie she told Andrew she loved him. Since then it's been smooth sailing. <br><br>

        <h3>The Proposal</h3>
        <p>
            Emily is very fond of the canal, downtown, and the tall buildings, and Andrew likes suprises. Andrew picked
            out a diamond and had it on hold, Emily and her friends went to look at rings, and picked out what she
            liked. Andrew went back to Diamonds Direct to get the setting Emily picked out (almost got it in the wrong
            color), and proceded to plan a surprise. For weeks Andrew told Emily that a proposal wouldn't happen until
            the Fall, but on July 3, 2020 Andrew had his sister hide at a bridge on the canal and wait for them to show
            up. After talking for a few minutes Andrew said there will be no proposal in the Fall, and that it was
            happening right now, and got down on one knee. Emily was very surprised, and said "Of course!" and then "You
            suck!!" because she was so caught off guard. They proceded to have a photo shoot along the canal, scooter
            around downtown, dinner at St. Elmo's, and then a surprise party in Noblesville with all our family. They
            finished the night playing with sparklers to "Let Love Sparkle!!"
